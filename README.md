# File Comparison Script (diff.py)

This Python script compares two text files line by line and identifies any differences between them.

## How it works

The script prompts the user to enter the names of two files to compare. It then reads each file, removes leading and trailing whitespace from each line, and compares the files line by line.

If a difference is found, the script sets a flag (`difference_found`) to `True`.

## Specifications

- The script uses the built-in `open()` function to read the files and the `readlines()` method to read the content line by line.
- The `strip()` method is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace from each line.
- The script uses a `for` loop to iterate over the lines in the files. The range of the loop is determined by the length of the smaller file to avoid an `IndexError`.
- The script uses an `if` statement inside the loop to compare each line from the two files. If a difference is found, it sets `difference_found` to `True`.

## Usage

Run the script in a Python environment and enter the names of the files to compare when prompted. The files should be in the same directory as the script and should have a `.txt` extension.

```bash
python diff.py
